Currently, my focus is to find a junior developer role working with Python or JavaScript.
I love data science and web development and am currently working on my JavaScript and Data structure and algorithm certifications.
Applied knowledge of SQL for record keeping. I attended saddleback for 2 years studying mathematics and science. I consistently 
contribute strong problem-solving and interpersonal skills to my work and rely on my adaptive mindset.
